 Google Cloud Fundamentals :Getting started with Compute Engine


Objectives:

You'll learn how to Create the following in the Google Cloud Platform


Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the  Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Create a Compute Engine Virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

Connect between the two instances.

Create a virtual machine using the command line 

Steps:

Create a virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform(GCP) console.

gcloud  compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-streach-v2020315" --subnet "debian" --tags http.


Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command-line.

gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

gcloud  compute instances create my-vm-2 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-streach-v2020315" --subnet "debian" --tags http.


Connect between the two instances.

Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the other network.

Connect to vm-2:

gcloud ssh my-vm-2

Ping my-vm-1 to my-vm-2:

ping -c  4 my-vm-1

Use the ssh command to command prompt on my-vm-1 to my-vm-2:

ssh my-vm-1

At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the nginx web server:

sudo apt-get install Nginx-light-y

Use nano text editor for message to add a custom image to the homepage server:

sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

Add this text, and replace it with YOUR_NAME:

Hi from Andrew

Exit from the the text editor and confirm that the web server is serving the application a new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command

curl http://localhost/

Result:

The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.

To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

exit

Confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 on the web server, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command

curl http://my-vm-1/

Get my external IP of my-vm-1 instance from this command:

gcloud compute instances list

Paste the copied IP address of my-vm-1 into a new browser tab and hit Enter

gcloud compute instance --list us-central1-b
