Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE 


Objectives:

You'll learn how to Create the following in the Google Cloud Platform

Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.

Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.


Steps:

Confirm that needed APIs are enabled

In the  Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console, on the Navigation menu,Click API's and Services



Scroll down in the list of enabled APIs, and confirm that both of these APIs are enabled:

Kubernetes Engine API
Container Registry API

If either API is missing, click Enable APIs and Services at the top.


Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster:

place the zone that Qwiklabs assigned you to into an environment variable called MY_ZONE.

At the Cloud Shell prompt, type this partial command:


export MY_ZONE=

export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a

Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes:

gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2

The cluster is created, then check installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command:

kubectl version

This command automatically authenticates for you.

gcloud container clusters create kubectl


Run and deploy a container 

From the Cloud Shell prompt, a single instance of the nginx container is  launched using this command. 

kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10


View the pod running the nginx container using this command:

kubectl get pods


Expose the nginx container to the Internet using this command:

kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer


View the new service command:


kubectl get services


the External-IP field I take a few seconds before it's populated re-run the  command every few seconds:

kubectl get services


Scale up the number of pods running on your service using this command:

kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3


Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:

kubectl get pods

 
Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:

kubectl get services
